# path\_to\_unicode\_filename

The library encodes file path separators and common directory names, producing a reversible unicode string that can be used as a filename. It's useful in the case when you want to extract data or features from any file and store them in a specific directory.

It replaces path chars as below:

- chars `\/:*?"<>|` be replaced to full width alternative chars of unicode.
- U+0000 be replaced to `〇`.
- a common directory, like home, documents, pictures, etc are replaced to a OS icon (🍎, 🐧, etc) and a directory icon (🏠, 📄, 🎨, etc).
- chars replacements for others be replaced to twice-sequential chars itself

## Examples

```rust
use path_to_unicode_filename::*;

assert_eq!(to_filename("/tmp/file.txt"), Ok("／tmp／file.txt".into()));
 
assert_eq!(to_filename("C:\\Users\\alice\\file.txt"), Ok("💠🏠alice＼file.txt".into()));
 
assert_eq!(to_filename("/Users/alice/Documents/file.txt"), Ok("🍎📄alice／file.txt".into()));
```
